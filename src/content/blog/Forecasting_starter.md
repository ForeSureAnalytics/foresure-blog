# Forecasting is a Necessity: A Bare Minimum Starter You Will Actually Use

Forecasting matters because uncertainty taxes every decision. If you do not set an informed expectation of demand, you either over order and tie up cash, or under order and miss sales. A simple forecast creates a common reference point for teams, speeds up routine decisions, and reduces the stress of arguing by anecdote. This starter app exists for that purpose. It converts raw transactions into a short, defensible outlook that you can act on today without a long build. If that is the step you need right now, you can try it here: **[Open the forecasting app](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/edc8c7b5-9064-4a9d-b32b-63902044e98b)**.

## The practical middle path

I built a lightweight web app because most small teams are stuck between nothing and way too much. Spreadsheets are flexible, but they hide logic in cells, drift as templates are copied, and are hard to standardize across SKUs. A simple app removes friction. You upload one CSV with three columns, the app validates and cleans, and you leave with a transparent forecast and uncertainty that you can explain. This is a minimum viable approach. It will help you build a weekly rhythm and learn the language of forecasting before you commit to a heavier platform.

## Who this is for

Owners, operators, inventory planners, and fractional COOs who want a practical baseline. If you run an ecommerce catalog, a retail assortment, or a simple wholesale line and you have basic sales history, this helps you get from raw data to a six month outlook with confidence bounds in minutes. The tone and intent match our brand promise to simplify data and enable pragmatic action for small businesses.

## What the tool actually does

You upload a CSV with **Sale Date**, **SKU**, and **Quantity**. The app parses headers, ignores blank rows, standardizes SKU casing, and aggregates to a regular **monthly** series per SKU. Missing months are filled with zeros so the math does not skip gaps and the sequence stays consistent over time.

The app checks whether each series behaves like a level, a trend, or a seasonal pattern. Seasonality is considered only when the signal is strong enough and there is enough history to support it. Eligible methods are tuned by grid search and evaluated with rolling origin cross validation using a composite of WAPE, sMAPE, and RMSE. The best scoring method for that SKU is selected.

Uncertainty bands are built from residuals when available. The app computes a standard error and applies a z score to produce upper and lower bounds per horizon. If residuals are not available, a conservative percentage fallback is used so the bands remain honest rather than optimistic.

The app also provides two planning helpers. The first is a **reorder point** formula that blends lead time and a service posture into a safety stock term. In code, the default lead time is seven time units, which in a monthly workflow should be reviewed and adjusted in your process. The second is a **six month total forecast** with a ten percent buffer. This is a quick planning nudge, not a supplier aware purchase order. The app does not know your on hand, open POs, MOQs, or pack sizes.

## What the tool does not do yet

This is a starter, not a system of record. It will not replace a specified forecasting platform and it is not intended to. Everything is monthly, so if you buy weekly or plan promotions weekly you will need a next step that runs at that grain. New items with little or no history, extremely intermittent demand, heavy promotion calendars, frequent price changes, and complex multi node networks with transfers are outside the scope of this starter. Supplier volatility still matters. If lead times are inaccurate, any model will be swamped.

## Real world snapshot for a multi SKU catalog

Assume one year of history and monthly aggregation.

- **SKU A**  
  The series is steady. The selector will likely choose simple exponential smoothing. The six month total plus buffer becomes your high level planning anchor. Compare that total to your own constraints like cash, MOQ, and pack sizes before issuing a PO.

- **SKU B**  
  The series trends upward. The selector will likely choose double exponential smoothing with a damped trend. The six month outlook rises modestly month over month. Use the lower and upper bands to frame a conservative and an aggressive buy scenario for your next cycle.

- **SKU C**  
  The series shows a clear seasonal spike each December with enough cycles in history to trust. The selector will consider a seasonal model. The forecast will reflect higher winter demand with wider bands near the peak. If your working capital is tight, plan a split receipt timed to the seasonal ramp rather than one large order.

This example shows how to use the outputs. The app gives you a clean monthly outlook and honest uncertainty. You bring in your realities like on hand, open POs, MOQs, and vendor pack sizes to finalize the buy.

## Why a web app instead of a spreadsheet

Spreadsheets are ideal for tinkering and teaching. They are not ideal for running the same logic across many SKUs every month while keeping parameters consistent and the audit trail intact. A web app is faster to run, harder to break, and easier to repeat. It lets the machine do the background work of parameter search and backtesting, then brings you an answer with caveats you can see.

## How to use this responsibly

Treat this as an on ramp to forecasting. Use it to build a weekly or monthly review habit and a shared vocabulary for demand. Make one clear decision each cycle and track how actuals land against the bands. As your stakes grow, step up to a specified solution that models promotions, uses weekly data where needed, incorporates cost of stockouts, and respects supplier realities directly.

## Try the app

If you have a CSV with dates, SKUs, and quantities, you can get a defensible baseline in minutes. **[Open the forecasting app](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/edc8c7b5-9064-4a9d-b32b-63902044e98b)**.
